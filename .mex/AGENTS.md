## What This Is
<!-- One sentence. What does this project do?
     Length: 1 sentence maximum.
     Not a tagline — a factual description of what the software does.
     Example: "A REST API for managing inventory across multiple warehouse locations." -->

## Non-Negotiables
<!-- Hard rules the agent must never violate. Not preferences — rules.
     These are the things that, if broken, cause real damage to the codebase.
     Length: 3-5 items. More than 5 means the list has not been prioritised.
     Example:
     - Never write database queries outside of the repository layer
     - Never commit secrets or API keys
     - Always handle errors explicitly — no silent failures -->

## Commands
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Test: `npm test`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Build: `npm run build`

Use the smallest relevant structured resolver. For Inbox or Relay mutations, resolve only the intended action with `mex inbox contract --action <command-id> --json` or `mex relay contract --action <command-id> --json`; use `mex capabilities --json` only for broader capability discovery. If the user explicitly asks to create, save, or draft a checkout-local Inbox or Relay draft, preview and apply that exact draft without asking for redundant confirmation. Deleting a local draft, or publishing, approving, rejecting, withdrawing, marking stale, repairing, taking or acknowledging, or closing, requires fresh explicit confirmation after semantic preview. Treat Git commit, push, and pull as separate actions requiring their own authorization.

## Scaffold Growth
After every task: if no pattern exists for the task type you just completed, create one. If a pattern or context file is now out of date, update it. The scaffold grows from real work, not just setup. See the GROW step in `ROUTER.md` for details.

## Navigation
At the start of every session, read `ROUTER.md` before doing anything else.
For full project context, patterns, and task guidance — everything is there.

## MEX context policy
- When MEX context materially influences an answer or implementation, include one concise acknowledgement: `MEX context used: <specific records/files/entities consulted>.`
- Do not claim an author, date, or historical event unless the retrieved data actually provides it.
- After a MEX write, say exactly what changed and its sharing boundary: a local draft is checkout-only and nothing is shared; a canonical artifact is written to the working tree and requires commit/push to share.
- Skill activation is not approval for canonical actions.
